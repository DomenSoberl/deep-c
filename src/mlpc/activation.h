 * \brief  Activation functions
 *
 * This module defines several activation functions and their derivatives that
 * can be used with neural networks. Activation functions and their derivatives
 * are defined as C functions of type `double f(double)`. They are not visible
 * outside the module, but can be obtained as the `ActivationFunction` type of
 * pointers.
 * 
 * The derivative functions expect as the input the output of their
 * corresponding activation function. This requires less computation and
 * less storage in the neural network. Luckily, all derivative functions use
 * here can be defined to work with activation outputs.

 * When not using an activation function, provide the ACTIVATION_NONE code.
 * This is equivalent to using the linear activation function f(x) = x.
